# Pietraszko uses a password which is very difficult to guess.
# At first, try to hack an account of a person which is not as cautious as Pietraszko.
# 
# But who is the weakest point? Initial investigation suggests that John Insecure doesn't care about security and has an account on the Proton server. He may use a password which is easy to crack.
# Let's attack his account first!
#   
#   Problem 1: Find the login of John Insecure.
# 
# Bit has scrapped 'employees' data (names and logins) from the www web page of Technical University of Warsaw. The data is in the data.frame `employees`. 
# Now, your task is to find John Insecure's login.
# When you finally find out what John's login is, use `proton(action = "login", login="XYZ")` command, where XYZ is Insecure's login.
